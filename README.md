# APT_railway
This project is part of the larger initiative, APT (Ai Planned Trips), which is currently under development and will be deployed soon. APT_Railway is one of the key features of the APT project, designed to optimise railway ticketing. Work on the APT project is progressing steadily toward its release.

#some details about Guaranteed Seat Assistance:
In Indian Railways, if a ticket is unavailable between your boarding and destination stations for a train, you have two alternative methods to book your ticket, since the availability of tickets depends on boarding and destination points:
Type-1: It generates a list of all possible routes with extended boarding and destination stations in ascending order of distance, where you can check availability.
Type-2: It offers a breakdown version where you may need to book two or more tickets to secure confirmed tickets. It generates all possible routes with extended boarding and destination stations, including intermediate stations, in ascending order of distance.
Website Features and Benefits
This website which is currently available uses the type-1 algorithm to help users book confirmed train tickets at optimal costs. It surpasses existing third-party ticketing solutions in efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. This website is limited to train 20804, as this algorithm uses distances between each station.

#for all other trains
